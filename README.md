PWA that tracks Sun activity (coronal mass ejections, solar flares) with data provided by NASA's DONKI API. 

Initially, this application was an exercise in Array iteration, ES6 synatx, DOM manipulation, Third-Party API methods, and fetch requests. Now, I have learned to further optimize applications through Lighthouse audits, minifying the codebase, and using cache data to enable offline functionality.
